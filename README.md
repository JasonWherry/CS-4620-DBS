DataBase Systems was a terrific course for learning applicable knowledge that can make one useful quick. Understanding SQL is essential to communicate with data. In this course we started with relational Algebra and finished by implementing an Oracle DataBase with a JODBC program. Taught by Dr. Marling, I took this course during my senior year of college.
